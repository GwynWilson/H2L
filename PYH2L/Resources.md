These are the main two resources that I have used to get started:
* https://machinelearningmastery.com/handwritten-digit-recognition-using-convolutional-neural-networks-python-keras/
* https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2014/09/22/getting-started-deep-learning-python/

Two potentially useful HOOG resources
*https://gurus.pyimagesearch.com/lesson-sample-histogram-of-oriented-gradients-and-car-logo-recognition/
*https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2014/11/10/histogram-oriented-gradients-object-detection/
